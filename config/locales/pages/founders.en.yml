        title: "Application"
        paragraph1: "The Our Cities Network is accepting applications for the Founders Program. The program begins with 6-weeks residency at the Network headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. Before submitting your application, please read the following program details:"
        paragraph3: "More info: <a href='contact@ourcities.org'>contact@ourcities.org</a>"
        li1: "Candidates should have advanced English, as the training will be carried out in English with participants from around the world.  If you do not feel comfortable participating in a residency conducted in English, you can still apply to participate in future selection processes.  Please specify this on your application form."
        li2: "If you are interested in participating in the Founders Program of the Our Cities Network, click on the \"Apply Now\" button below along with a one to three minute long video (in English) responding to the following question: “Why does your city need a mobilization network?” We will focus more on the content of the videos than on the production quality. And we encourage you to submit early due to the high volume of applications. A link for the video (uploaded on Youtube or Vimeo) should be sent to <a href='mailto:applications@ourcities.org'>applications@ourcities.org</a> using the same email address that you used in the application form."
        li3: "Standout candidates will receive a written exercise on mobilization strategy. This will be a good way for the candidates to show their creativity and strategic thinking."
        li4: "After the written exercise, we will schedule an online interview with selected candidates. We will conduct the interviews via Google Hangout. Interviews will last no longer than one and a half ours and will be scheduled based on the availability of the candidate and of the Our Cities team."
        li5: "Pre-selected candidates will be notified by email."
        li7: "Applications are made on an individual basis, however, our experience has shown that a well-tuned and diverse team is a determining factor for a network’s success.  Pre-selected candidates have the opportunity to start building a team, recommending as many as three additional candidates for participation in the residency. These recommended candidates should fill out the application form and those that stand out will be invited for an interview. The Our Cities Network team makes the final decision about which candidates will participate in the residency."
        li8: "Selected candidates will receive support from the Our Cities Team to write a script, produce a video, and launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money that will subsidize part of the costs of the Founders’ training program."
        li8_1: "The crowdfunding campaign is a way to verify that the potential for a culture of small donations for projects like the Our Cities Network exists in the city, as this is one of the main strategies for financial sustainability. Beyond this, the campaign tests the candidate’s capacity to mobilize people to make the project happen."
        li8_2: "The crowdfunding campaign will last between 30 and 40 days."
        li8_3: "The goal of the crowdfunding campaign will be between USD 3,000 and USD 12,000 per candidate, depending on the size of the candidate’s city and the costs of the candidate’s travel to Rio de Janeiro. Funds raised will serve as each city’s contribution to the total investiment that the Our Cities Network is making in this phase of replication of our model."
        li9: "Candidates that reach their crowdfunding goal will be invited to participate in the residency in Rio de Janeiro. During this period, they will participate in a complete training on mobilization technologies to transform cities with the Our Cities Network team and other well-known professionals."
        li10: "After the residency, candidates that successfully plan and launch their networks will begin a phase of incubation and accompaniment by the Our Cities team that will last up to 1 year. During this period, candidates will receive support to structure their network, launch their first campaigns and raise funds to sustain their local organization."
        li11: "The candidates will be recognized as Founders once they select a board for their network, form a local support team, and launch their first campaign."
        li12: "To guarantee financal sustainability and the continual development and use of the Network’s tools and platforms, each mobilization network will be asked to contribute 15% of the funds it raises back to the Our Cities Network."
