        paragraph1: "The Our Cities Network is accepting applications for its second class of Founders. The program begins with a residency in September or October at the Network headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. Before submitting your application, please read the program details below:"
        paragraph2: "We will select founders for the Our Cities Network once more in 2015."
        paragraph3: "More info: <a href='contact@ourcities.org'>contact@ourcities.org</a>"
        li1: "If you are interested in participating in the second class of Founders of the Our Cities Network, click on the button below, complete your application and send it to us by 11:59 p.m on May 30, along with a one to three minute long video responding to the following question: “Why does your city need a mobilization network?” We encourage you to submit early due to the high volume of applications. The video's link (uploaded on Youtube or Vimeo) should be sent to founders@ourcities.org using the same email address that you used in the application form with your full name + “video” in the subject line."
        li2: "<strong>In June</strong>, standout candidates will receive a written exercise on mobilization strategy. This will be a good way for the candidates to show their creativity and strategic thinking."
        li3_1: "After the written exercise, an online interview will be scheduled with the selected candidates. We will conduct the interviews via Google Hangout in late June and early July. Interviews will last no longer than one and a half ours and will be scheduled based on the availability of the candidate and the Our Cities team."
        li3_2: "Applications are made on an individual basis, however, should more than one candidate be selected from the same city, we will organize specific stage in the process to form a team."
        li3_3: "Pre-selected candidates will be notified in July."
        li5: "In July and August, pre-selected candidates will receive support from the Our Cities Team to write a script, produce a video and launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money that will subsidize part of the costs of the founders’ training program."
        li5_1: "The crowdfunding campaign is a way to verify that the potential for a culture of small donations for projects like the Our Cities Network exists in the city, especially since this is one of the main strategies for financial sustainability. Beyond this, it tests the candidate’s capacity to mobilize people to make the project happen."
        li5_1_1: "The crowdfunding campaign will last between 30 and 40 days. "
        li5_2: "The goal of the crowdfunding campaign will be between USD 3,000 and USD 12,000 per candidate, depending on the size of the candidate’s city and the costs of the candidate’s travel to Rio de Janeiro. Funds raised will serve as each city’s contribution to the total investiment that the Our Cities Network is making in this first phase of replication of our model. New cities will make this initial contribution to the Network through the crowdfunding campaign and, once fully operational, will contribute 15% of the money they raise to sustain their organizations. This contribution will cover the candidates’ transportation and lodging during a one-month residency in Rio de Janeiro, the adaptation of the Network’s applications for the candidates’ city (Ex: Panela de Pressão, Multitude, Compartilhaço, among others) the shared services of technology, design, legal support and the salaries of the Our Cities Network team that will accompany selected candidates during the incubation period of up to one year."
        li6: "Candidates that reach their crowdfunding goal will be invited to participate in the residency in Rio de Janeiro in September or October 2015. During this period, they will participate in a complete training on mobilization technologies to transform cities, with the Meu Rio team and other well-known professionals."
        li7: "After the residency, candidates that successfully plan and launch their network will begin a phase of incubation and accompaniment by the Our Cities team that will last up to 1 year. During this period, candidates will receive support to structure their network, launch their first mobilizations and raise funds to sustain their local organization."
        li8: "The candidates will be recognized as founders once they select a board for their Network, form a local support team and launch their first mobilization."
