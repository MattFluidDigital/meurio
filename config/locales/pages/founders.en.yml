        paragraph1: "The Our Cities Network is accepting applications for its first class of Founders, whose residency will take place from March 15th to April 15th  at the Network headquarters in Rio de Janeiro.  Before submitting your application, please read the program details below:"
        paragraph2: "We will select founders for the Our Cities Network twice more in 2015, with residencies planned for August and December."
        paragraph3: "More info: <a href='contact@ourcities.org'>contact@ourcities.org</a>"
        li1: "If you would like to participate in the first class of Founders of the Our Cities Network, click on the button below, complete your application and send it to us by 11:59 on November 30, along with a video of up to 3 minutes responding to the following question: “Why does your city need a mobilization network?” The earlier you submit, the better your chances! The video should be sent to founders@ourcities.org using the same email address that you used in the application form with your full name + “video” in the subject line."
        li2: "<strong>On December 4th</strong>, standout candidates will receive a written exercise on mobilization strategy, <strong>which should be turned in by December 8th.</strong> This will be a good way for the candidates to show their creativity and strategic thinking."
        li3: "After the written exercise, the team will schedule a virtual interview with selected candidates.  The interviews will last no longer than 1.5 hours and will be conducted via Google Hangout from December 15-21 according to the availability of the candidate and the team."
        li4: "Pre-selected candidates will be notified on <strong>December 23!</strong>"
        li5: "From January 5th to February 28th, pre-selected candidates will receive support from the Our Cities Team to write a script, produce a video and launch a crowdfunding campaign to raise money that will subsidize part of the costs of the founders’ training program."
        li5_1: "The crowdfunding campaign is a way to verify that the potential for a culture of small donations for projects like the Our Cities Network exists in the city, especially since this is one of the main strategies for financial sustainability. Beyond this, it tests the candidate’s capacity to mobilize his or her own network to make the project happen."
        li5_2: "The goal of the crowdfunding campaign will be R$9,000.00, which accounts for 25% of the total cost of R$36,250.00 to install the Network in a new city. The Our Cities Network will cover the other 75% of the costs during this first phase of replication.   These R$9,000.00 will pay for the candidates’ transportation and lodging during a one-month residency in Rio de Janeiro, the adaptation of the Network’s applications for the candidates’ city (Ex: Panela de Pressão, Multitude, Compartilhaço, among others) the shared services of technology, design, legal support and the salaries of the Our Cities Network team, that will accompany selected candidates during the incubation period of up to one year."
        li6: "Candidates that reach their crowdfunding goal will be invited to participate in the residency in Rio de Janeiro from March 15 – April 15.  During this period, they will participate in a complete training with the Meu Rio team and other well-known professionals in mobilization methodologies and technologies to transform their cities."
        li7: "After the residency, candidates that successfully plan the launch of their network will begin a phase of incubation and accompaniment by the Our Cities team that will last up to 1 year. During this period, candidates will receive support to structure their network, launch their first mobilizations and raise funds to sustain their local organization."
        li8: "The candidates will be recognized as founders once they select a board for their Network, form a local support team and launch their first mobilization."
